# Project 2 Hangman 

This is the second project for INST126 for the Fall 2020 semester at the University of Maryland.
We are using our knowledge of functions, arrays, and loops to make a simple hangman program.

## How to work 

When you run the program, it will ask you for a letter, you have 10 tries to guess the word correctly, 
remember that once you enter a letter, you can't enter it again 


```python 
for example it will look like: 
You have 10 lives left and you have used these letters: 
Current word:  - - - -
Guess a letter:
 > d 
 You have 10 lives left and you have used these letters:  D
Current word:  D - - -

Once you guess the word, you get the following output
Yay! You guessed the word!
Here is the word you guessed: DNPK
This was an encrypted message!
The decoded message says: COOL
 ```
