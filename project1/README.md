# Project 1 Calculator 

This is the first project for INST126 for the Fall 2020 semester at the University of Maryland.
We are using our knowledge of conditonals to make a basic calculator that allows the user to do 
operations such as addition, subtraction, multipulication, and division 

## How to work 

When you run the program, it will ask you for the name of your operation! 
Please make sure to enter the name of your operation and not the number next to it 
or else it will not work. You could also quit the program by entering quit when asked for your operation


```python 
   for example addition operation will look like 
   Enter operation name: 
 1. Addition
 2. Subtraction
 3. Multiplication
 4. Division
 5. Square Root
 6. Power 
 Quit to exit the calculator

 ```
