# Project 1 Calculator 

This is the first project for INST126 for the Fall 2020 semester at the University of Maryland.
We are using our knowledge of conditonals to make a basic calculator that allows the user to do 
operations such as addition, subtraction, multipulication, and division 

## How to work 

When you run the program, it will ask you for the name of your operation! 
Please make sure to enter the name of your operation and not the number next to it 
or else it will not work. You could also quit the program by entering quit when asked for your operation


For example: to select the operation addition, please type in "addition" when asked by the program 
             after that, it will ask you to input to numbers, please make sure to put a space between the two numbers 
             so the program can read them as two seperate numbers!
